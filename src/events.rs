// http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Events

//! Rust uses condition variables (Condvars) for asynchronous event processing.  Each Mutex has a
//! list of zero or more Condvars, which are essentially events that the task may wait on or signal
//! when it holds the mutex.  When a task begins to wait on a condvar, it enters a waiting state
//! until the condvar is signaled by another task, at which point it resumes processing.  Thus,
//! each condvar represents an event on which a task may wait.  The one subtlety is that condvar
//! signals are only received if there is actually a task waiting on the signal--see the below
//! program for an example of how this may be achieved in practice.
