//! This implementation isn't based on anything in particular, although it's probably informed by a
//! lot of Rust's JSON encoding code.  It should be very fast (both encoding and decoding the toy
//! example here takes under a microsecond on my machine) and tries to avoid unnecessary allocation.
//!
//! In a real implementation, most of this would be private, with only a few visible functions, and
//! there would be somewhat nicer signatures (in particular, the fact that `ParseContext` has to be
//! mutable would get annoying in real code pretty quickly, so it would probably be split out).
//!
//! It supports the ability to read individual atoms, not just lists, although whether this is
//! useful is questionable.
//!
//! Caveats: Does not support symbols vs. non-symbols (it wouldn't be hard, but it would greatly
//! complicate setting up our test structure since we'd have to force it to go through functions
//! that checked to make sure `Symbol`s couldn't have spaces, or slow down our parser by checking
//! for this information each time, which is obnoxious).  Does not support string escaping, because
//! the decoding technique doesn't allocate extra space for strings.  Does support numbers, but
//! only float types (supporting more types is possible but would complicate the code
//! significantly).
